# ASSEMBLY_SimpleTypeConversion

Two projects are present:

#### IntToString

IntToString is a simple project to convert integer to string, and display the result.

The purpose of the project is to understand byte and bits manipulation in assembly. It helps also understand the type notion present in higher level programming language.

#### StringToIntToString

StringToIntToString is another project with three objectives.

First, to convert a user input into integer. 
Second, multiplying the user input 
Third, display the result.

It uses all concepts and different projects previously created in order to try to do a synthesis.

None of these projects are 'completed'. A verification of user input, exception management, even addition directly on String could be done. It wasn't the goal of these projects. The purpose was to gain knowledge about type manipulation in assembly code.

## Execution

To see all phases needed to create the executable, you can relate to the script provided. 

```bash
./compile_execute.sh
```

```bash
./string_to_int_to_string.sh
```

## Conclusion of these simple projects

Assembly code is very a lot of fun. Concepts behind it are passionating, but its only the introduction of the 'infinite rabbit hole' of computer science theory from computer craftmanship.

I really encourage you to try Assembly Code. You can start at : https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2023/#gsc.tab=0
