# ASSEMBLY_SimpleTypeConversion

Two projects are present:

#### IntToString

IntToString is a simple project which purpose is to convert integer to string, and to display the result.

The goal of the project is to understand byte and bits manipulation in Assembly. It also helps to understand the 'type' notion present in higher level programming languages.

#### StringToIntToString

StringToIntToString is another project with three objectives.

First, to convert user inputs into integer. 
Second, multiplying the user inputs.
Third, to display the result.

It uses all concepts and differents projects previously created in order to do a synthesis.

None of these projects are 'completed'. A verification of user inputs, exception management, even addition directly on String, could be done. It wasn't the goal of these projects. The purpose was to gain knowledge about 'type' manipulation in Assembly code, which is the latest human readable programming language.

## Execution

To see all phases needed to create the executables, you can relate to the script provided. 

```bash
./int_to_string.sh
```

```bash
./string_to_int_to_string.sh
```

## Conclusion of these simple projects

Assembly code is a lot of fun. Concepts behind it are passionating, but it is only the introduction of the long journey of computer science theory emanating from computer craftmanship.

I really encourage you to try Assembly Code. You can start at : https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2023/#gsc.tab=0
